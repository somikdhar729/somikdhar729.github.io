<h1>Hi, I’m Somik — I build real-time perception and autonomy systems.</h1>
<p align=”justify” text-align: "justify">I’m an AI & Perception Engineer at NextLeap Aeronautics, where I design and deploy real-time vision and control pipelines for UAVs. My work spans low-latency video streaming, embedded inference, multi-threaded optimizations, sensor integration, and perception-guided flight under edge-compute constraints.  </p>

<p align=”justify” text-align: "justify"> Before joining NextLeap, I completed my MS at NYU, where I worked on Visual Place Recognition (VPR) and built sequence-based localization algorithms for GPS-denied environments. That experience shaped my interest in robust perception, SLAM-style pipelines, and algorithmic evaluation at scale. </p>

<p align="justify" text-align:"justify"> Across both industry and research, I’ve built systems involving:
* Real-time computer vision and ML inference
* Embedded deployment on Jetson (Xavier/Orin) and Raspberry Pi
* Multi-robot control, CLF/CBF controllers, and PID motion systems
* Vision-based navigation and early-stage GNSS-denied autonomy
* CUDA/GPU optimization for performance-critical pipelines </p>

<p align="justify" text-align:"justify">I enjoy working on problems where correctness, latency, and reliability matter—and where the solution requires both strong engineering fundamentals and iterative experimentation.  </p>

If you're building ML, robotics, or high-performance perception systems, I’d love to connect.
